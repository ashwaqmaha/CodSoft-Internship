              Cassius Clay Sr. gifted his son a new red-and-white Schwinn in
              1954, which was promptly stolen. The 12-year-old, 89-pound Cassius
              Clay vowed “I'm gonna whup whoever stole my bike!” A policeman,
              Joe Martin, told young Cassius Clay that he better learn how to
              fight before he challenged anyone. After 6 months of training with
              Joe Martin, Cassius won his debut match in a three-round decision.
              Young Cassius Clay dedicated himself to boxing and training with
              an unmatched fervor. According to Joe Martin, Clay set himself
              apart by two things: He was “sassy,” and he outworked all the
              other boys.

              Muhammad Ali participated in the light-heavyweight class Golden
              Gloves tournament for novices in 1956. It took him three years,
              but finally in 1959, Ali was named Golden Gloves Champion and
              earned the Amateur Athletic Union's national title in the
              light-heavyweight division.

              Shortly after his high school graduation, 18 year-old Cassius Clay
              began his journey towards greatness at the 1960 Rome Olympics. His
              expansive personality and larger-than-life spirit earned him the
              nickname “The Mayor of Olympic Village.” The future 3-time
              Heavyweight World Champion nearly missed the trip to Rome due to
              his fear of airplane travel; he insisted on bringing a parachute
              on the plane with him. On September 5, 1960, “The Greatest” proved
              his dominance in the Light Heavyweight Boxing Division by beating
              Zigzy Pietrzykowski of Poland, capturing the Olympic Gold Medal.
              Sports Illustrated praised Clay's “supreme confidence” and
              “intricate dance steps.”

              While training for his title bout against the fearsome heavyweight
              champion, Sonny Liston, Cassius Clay met Malcolm X. Malcolm became
              young Clay's mentor and brought him into the Nation of Islam
              (NOI). Despite the 7-1 odds, Clay defeated Sonny Liston in Miami
              and became Heavyweight Champion of the world in 1964. Shortly
              after, he announced to the world that he was a member of the NOI
              and that his name was now Muhammad Ali.

              Muhammad Ali was stripped of his boxing titles and faced a prison
              sentence for refusing the Vietnam War draft. During his 3 ½ year
              suspension, he made a living speaking at colleges. In 1970, as
              public opinion shifted, Ali made a comeback by fighting Jerry
              Quarry and Oscar Bonavena. In 1971, he fought Joe Frazier in the
              "Fight of the Century" but lost. Months later, however, he won one
              of the biggest fights of his life - the Supreme Court overturned
              his conviction, allowing him to resume his boxing career.

              In 1984, Muhammad Ali publicly announced that he had Parkinson's
              disease, a degenerative neurological condition. Following his
              diagnosis, he created and raised funds for the Muhammad Ali
              Parkinson's Center in Phoenix, Arizona.
